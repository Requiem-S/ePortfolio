## Professional Self-Assessment



## Code Review

I conducted a comprehensive code review of the Bid Management System, which served as the foundation for my enhancements. The code review video can be found [here]("https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Yu85qVz12oFvXc77Bc1MNtv5NYC_WRN/preview").

In this review, I analyzed the existing functionality, identified areas for improvement, and outlined my plans for enhancing the system across three key areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

## Software Design and Engineering

For the software design and engineering enhancement, I transformed the Bid Management System into a full-stack application. Key improvements include:

- Implemented a web server using the Crow framework for C++
- Created RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Developed user authentication and authorization using JWT
- Implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using TOTP
- Refactored existing code for better modularity and maintainability

These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design and implement scalable, secure, and efficient software solutions.

## Algorithms and Data Structure

To improve the system's performance and functionality, I implemented several algorithms and data structures:

- Developed a custom LinkedList class for sequential bid storage
- Created a HashMap class for O(1) lookup time of bids
- Implemented sorting functionality for bids
- Added binary search capability for efficient bid lookup
- Created a performance benchmark to compare LinkedList and HashMap lookup times

These enhancements showcase my skills in designing and implementing efficient algorithms and data structures to solve complex problems.

- [HashMap.cpp](artifacts/enhanced/HashMap.cpp)

## Databases

For the database enhancement, I focused on improving data management and retrieval:

- Set up a SQLite database for persistent storage
- Designed an optimized database schema for bids and related entities
- Implemented efficient CRUD operations
- Developed data access objects (DAOs) for each entity
- Used prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implemented query optimization for filtering, sorting, and pagination

These improvements demonstrate my ability to design and manage databases, ensure data integrity, and optimize database operations for performance.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my computer science program and the development of this ePortfolio, I've had the opportunity to strengthen my skills, shape my professional goals, and prepare for a career in the dynamic field of computer science. This journey has been transformative, allowing me to showcase my strengths and develop new competencies that are crucial in today's tech-driven world.

### Collaborating in a Team Environment

While the Bid Management System featured in this portfolio was an individual project, I have valuable experience collaborating in team environments from other courses. A notable example is the game development project I worked on using the Unreal engine in my Digital Game Development course. This project required close collaboration with team members, where we had to integrate different components of the game seamlessly. This experience honed my ability to communicate effectively with team members, manage version control, and contribute to a cohesive final product. The skills I developed during this project, such as task delegation, conflict resolution, and collaborative problem-solving, have prepared me well for team-based work in the professional world.

### Communicating with Stakeholders

Communication with stakeholders has been another area of focus throughout my program. In courses like Software Development Lifecycle and Collaboration and Team Project, I've had opportunities to present project proposals, progress reports, and final results to professors and peers acting as clients. These experiences have improved my ability to translate technical concepts into language accessible to non-technical stakeholders, a skill that's crucial in the professional world. For example, in the Client/Server Development course, I had to explain complex backend architectures to frontend developers (my classmates), which taught me how to bridge the gap between different areas of expertise.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

My work with data structures and algorithms has been particularly rewarding. The Bid Management System project showcases my ability to implement efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and filtering large datasets. In my Data Structures and Algorithms course, I delved deep into various data structures like trees, graphs, and hash tables, and learned to analyze algorithm efficiency. In the Fundamentals of Data Mining course, I applied these concepts to real-world problems, developing algorithms for pattern recognition and predictive modeling. These experiences have deepened my understanding of algorithmic principles and their practical applications.

### Software Engineering and Database

In software engineering and database management, I've gained proficiency in full-stack development. The Bid Management System demonstrates my ability to design and implement both frontend and backend components, as well as create and optimize database structures. My coursework in Introduction to Structured Database Environments provided a strong foundation in database design and SQL. The Software Development with C++.NET course enhanced my skills in backend development, while the Client/Server Development course taught me how to create robust APIs and manage client-server interactions. These diverse experiences have prepared me for the multifaceted challenges of modern software development.

### Security

Security has been a consistent theme throughout my studies. In the Bid Management System, I implemented measures to prevent SQL injection and ensure data privacy. While I didn't have a dedicated cybersecurity course, security principles were woven into many of my classes. For instance, in the Operating Environments course, we discussed the importance of secure system design and access control. In the Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance course, we learned about security testing and how to identify potential vulnerabilities in our code. These experiences have helped me develop a security mindset that's crucial in today's digital landscape.

### Portfolio Summary

The artifacts in this portfolio, centered around the Bid Management System, collectively demonstrate my ability to develop a comprehensive, full-stack application. They showcase my skills in frontend development, backend development with C++ and the Crow framework, database management with SQLite, and the implementation of security measures. These artifacts reflect my capacity to design and implement complex systems that solve real-world problems.

### Employability and Professional Growth

As I prepare to enter the computer science field, I feel confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to software development teams. The range of skills I've developed -- from algorithm design to database management, from game development to client/server architectures -- positions me well for roles in full-stack development, software engineering, or even game development. Courses like Computer Science's Role in Industry have given me insight into how my skills apply in various sectors.

The process of creating this ePortfolio has made me more employable by forcing me to reflect on and articulate my skills and experiences. It has also provided me with a powerful tool to showcase my abilities to potential employers, giving them a concrete demonstration of my capabilities beyond what a traditional resume can offer. The diverse coursework I've completed, from foundational courses like Discrete Mathematics and Applied Linear Algebra to application-focused courses like Computational Graphics and Visualization, demonstrates my well-rounded education and ability to tackle complex, multidisciplinary problems.

This ePortfolio serves as a comprehensive introduction to my capabilities in computer science, showcasing not just my technical skills, but also my problem-solving abilities, attention to security concerns, and capacity for clear communication. The following sections will delve deeper into the technical aspects of my work, demonstrating the full range of my computer science talents and abilities.


## Code Review

I conducted a comprehensive code review of the Bid Management System, which served as the foundation for my enhancements. [![Code Review Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUR_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Yu85qVz12oFvXc77Bc1MNtv5NYC_WRN/preview)

In this review, I analyzed the existing functionality, identified areas for improvement, and outlined my plans for enhancing the system across three key areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

## Software Design and Engineering

For the software design and engineering enhancement, I transformed the Bid Management System into a full-stack application. Key improvements include:

- Implemented a web server using the Crow framework for C++
- Created RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Developed user authentication and authorization using JWT
- Implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using TOTP
- Refactored existing code for better modularity and maintainability

These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design and implement scalable, secure, and efficient software solutions.

## Algorithms and Data Structure

To improve the system's performance and functionality, I implemented several algorithms and data structures:

- Developed a custom LinkedList class for sequential bid storage
- Created a HashMap class for O(1) lookup time of bids
- Implemented sorting functionality for bids
- Added binary search capability for efficient bid lookup
- Created a performance benchmark to compare LinkedList and HashMap lookup times

These enhancements showcase my skills in designing and implementing efficient algorithms and data structures to solve complex problems.

## Databases

For the database enhancement, I focused on improving data management and retrieval:

- Set up a SQLite database for persistent storage
- Designed an optimized database schema for bids and related entities
- Implemented efficient CRUD operations
- Developed data access objects (DAOs) for each entity
- Used prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implemented query optimization for filtering, sorting, and pagination

These improvements demonstrate my ability to design and manage databases, ensure data integrity, and optimize database operations for performance.

## Artifact Description

The artifact is part of a project from a previous course I took at SNHU as part of my journey to get my degree in Computer Science. I am using this same artifact for all three project enhancements, so my description will be similar for each category. I do not know when I took the course in which the artifact was created. The artifact is a basic bid management system that pulls bid data from a CSV file. The user can look up bids using the terminal window that opens when the code is compiled and run.

## Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio

I chose this artifact because I knew I could build a full-stack application covering all three enhancement categories. By creating the full-stack application, I have been able to showcase my skills with databases. By designing a database that supports collaborative data management, I was able to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science. I also created an API that allows the front-end and back-end to interact with each other.

## Course Objectives and Outcomes

While creating the database enhancement for my artifact, I met several course outcomes:

1. "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices."
   - Met through work on query optimization for filtering and sorting large datasets.
   - Implemented pagination to manage trade-offs between data retrieval speed and memory usage.
   - Combined in-memory data structures with database queries to balance query complexity, response time, and system resources.

2. "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals."
   - Demonstrated proficiency in SQL and database management systems.
   - Implemented prepared statements and parameterized queries.
   - Developed dynamic query construction based on user inputs.
   - Integrated the database with in-memory data structures for optimized performance.

3. "Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resource."
   - Implemented prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
   - Developed input validation before executing database queries.
   - Designed database access patterns to ensure users can only access appropriate data.
   - Ensured data integrity in database operations.

## Enhancements Applied

1. Database Design:
   - Designed efficient schema for storing bid information

2. Query Optimization:
   - Developed optimized SQL queries for filtering, sorting, and pagination

3. Data Integrity:
   - Implemented measures to ensure consistency across database operations

4. Performance Tuning:
   - Optimized database queries and indexing for improved performance

5. Security Measures:
   - Implemented prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
   - Developed input validation for database operations

6. Scalability:
   - Designed database structure and queries to handle large datasets

7. Data Import/Export:
   - Developed functionality to import data from CSV files into the database

8. Error Handling:
   - Implemented robust error handling for database operations

9. Integration:
   - Seamlessly integrated database operations with backend logic

10. Dynamic Query Construction:
    - Developed a system for dynamically building SQL queries based on user input

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

Enhancing this artifact has been a very challenging learning experience. At this point of the project, the full-stack application has been built without any future improvements I have yet to make. At the beginning of this project, I still felt very green in the world of computer science programming, and now, with this project complete, I have learned so many things in such a short amount of time that have significantly improved my skills and confidence in the programming world.

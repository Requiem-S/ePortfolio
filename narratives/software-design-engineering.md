## Artifact Description

The artifact is part of a project from a previous course I took at SNHU as part of my journey to get my degree in Computer Science. I do not have the exact date it was created, but it would have to have been a couple of years ago. The artifact is a basic bid management system that pulls bid data from a CSV file. The user can look up bids using the terminal window that opens when the code is compiled and run.

## Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio

I chose this artifact because it seemed like a simple application that could be turned into an application that is much more complex, such as a full-stack application. I have never built a full-stack application, so by building one, I will demonstrate my ability to work with databases, design efficient data models, and implement secure and scalable data management solutions. I will also showcase my ability to analyze and improve algorithmic efficiency, implement advanced data structures, and optimize code for better performance. These enhancements will also demonstrate my ability to apply software engineering principles to improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. This artifact has been improved in many ways. All of these improvements are provided in the list below.

## Course Objectives and Outcomes

I met several course outcomes while working on the first enhancement for my artifact:

1. "Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts." 
   - Met by implementing a RESTful API with a straightforward endpoint design for effective communication.

2. "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices." 
   - Met by implementing Crow for the server and creating a database with CRUD operations.

3. "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals." 
   - Met by using SQLite and SQLiteCpp, implementing MFA with TOPT, and creating a LinkedList class with sorting and search capabilities.

4. "Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources." 
   - Achieved by adding MFA and implementing JWT for enhanced security.

## Enhancements Applied

1. Frontend Development (React):
   - Implemented responsive UI for bid management
   - Created reusable components for filters, sorting, and pagination
   - Developed state management using React hooks

2. Backend Development (C++):
   - Built a RESTful API using the Crow framework
   - Implemented CRUD operations for bids
   - Developed JWT-based authentication system

3. API Design:
   - Designed and implemented endpoints for bid management
   - Created a clear separation between frontend and backend

4. Error Handling:
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling on both frontend and backend
   - Developed user-friendly error messages

5. CSV Import Functionality:
   - Developed a feature to import bids from CSV files

6. Deployment Preparation:
   - Created detailed deployment instructions for both frontend and backend

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

I learned to use many methods and tools I had never used before. This is a very big project, and I ran into a lot of troubleshooting just getting the code to compile. It took me almost five hours to troubleshoot and get cmake to build correctly using the PowerShell window. There was a lot of research and tutorial watching during the full stack build. I have yet to build the front-end part of the project, but I am getting very close to that section.

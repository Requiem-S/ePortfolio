The artifact is part of a project from a previous course I took at SNHU as part of my journey to get my degree in Computer Science.
 I do not have the exact date it was created, but it would have to have been a couple of years ago. The artifact is a basic bid management system that pulls bid data from a CSV file.
 The user can look up bids using the terminal window that opens when the code is compiled and run. I chose this artifact because it seemed like a simple application that could be turned into an application that is much more complex, such as a full-stack application.
 I have never built a full-stack application, so by building one, I will demonstrate my ability to work with databases, design efficient data models, and implement secure and scalable data management solutions.
 I will also showcase my ability to analyze and improve algorithmic efficiency, implement advanced data structures, and optimize code for better performance.
 These enhancements will also demonstrate my ability to apply software engineering principles to improve code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. This artifact has been improved in many ways.
 All these improvements are provided in the list below. I met several course outcomes while working on the first enhancement for my artifact. The first is to "Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts."
 I have met this outcome by implementing a RESTful API that requires a straightforward design of endpoints that effectively communicate with users and clients.
 The second is to "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices."
 I have met this outcome by implementing Crow for my server, which shows that I know how to select and use the correct tools for development. I have also met with this outcome by creating a database that uses CRUD operations. 
The third course outcome I aligned with is "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals".
 I have met with this outcome by using SQLite and SQLiteCpp as my database solution, demonstrating my ability to work with database technologies. I have also met this outcome by implementing an MFA with a TOPT, which shows my ability to enhance application security.
 A third reason I have met this outcome is by showing my skills in implementing and using data structures through the creation of the LinkedList class which has sorting and search capabilities.
Fourth is the course outcome: "Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources."
 I have achieved this course outcome by adding the MFA and implementing the JWT. Working together helps enhance the security of user accounts.
Some of my original enhancement plans changed while learning and building the full-stack application. Here is a list of all the software design and engineering enhancements I have applied to my artifact.
1.	Frontend Development (React): 
o	Implemented responsive UI for bid management
o	Created reusable components for filters, sorting, and pagination
o	Developed state management using React hooks
2.	Backend Development (C++): 
o	Built a RESTful API using the Crow framework
o	Implemented CRUD operations for bids
o	Developed JWT-based authentication system
3.	API Design: 
o	Designed and implemented endpoints for bid management
o	Created a clear separation between frontend and backend
4.	Error Handling: 
o	Implemented comprehensive error handling on both frontend and backend
o	Developed user-friendly error messages
5.	CSV Import Functionality: 
o	Developed a feature to import bids from CSV files
6.	Deployment Preparation: 
o	Created detailed deployment instructions for both frontend and backend

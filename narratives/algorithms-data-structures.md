## Artifact Description

The artifact is part of a project from a previous course I took at SNHU as part of my journey to get my degree in Computer Science. I am using this same artifact for all three project enhancements, so my description will be similar for each category. I do not know when I took the course in which the artifact was created. The artifact is a basic bid management system that pulls bid data from a CSV file. The user can look up bids using the terminal window that opens when the code is compiled and run.

## Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio

I chose this artifact because I knew I could build a full-stack application covering all three enhancement categories. This artifact would also give me the opportunity to show my skills in algorithms and data structures. I improved this artifact by creating custom data structures and implementing them into the Bid Management system.

## Course Objectives and Outcomes

I have met several course outcomes while creating the algorithms and data structures enhancement for my artifact:

1. "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices."
   - Met by designing and implementing efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and filtering bid data.
   - Demonstrated understanding of data structure trade-offs through the use of HashMap and LinkedList.
   - Implemented pagination algorithms considering performance and user experience.

2. "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals."
   - Implemented custom sorting algorithms, efficient search functionalities, and multi-criteria filtering.
   - Balanced in-memory operations with database queries to optimize system performance.
   - Used data structures like HashMap and LinkedList, combined with custom algorithms for data manipulation.

3. "Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science."
   - Designing modular and reusable algorithms that can be easily understood and maintained by diverse team members.
   - The implementation of sorting and filtering algorithms for easy collaboration and modification.
   - Creating clear interfaces between different algorithmic components that enable a collaborative environment where team members with varying levels of expertise can contribute effectively.

## Enhancements Applied

1. Sorting:
   - Implemented custom sorting algorithms for bid data
   - Added the ability to export bid data in sorted order

2. Searching:
   - Developed efficient search functionality across multiple fields
   - Added binary search capability for efficient bid lookup
   - Implemented a basic algorithm for suggesting similar bids based on characteristics

3. Pagination:
   - Implemented algorithm for paginating large datasets

4. Filtering:
   - Created algorithms for multi-criteria filtering of bids
   - Implemented algorithms for filtering by date ranges and bid amounts

5. Data Structures:
   - Implemented a custom LinkedList class for sequential bid storage and manipulation
   - Developed a HashMap class for O(1) lookup time of bids
   - Integrated LinkedList and HashMap into the DatabaseManager class

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Developed algorithms to balance between in-memory and database operations
   - Created a performance benchmark to compare LinkedList and HashMap lookup times
   - Added functionality to resize the HashMap to maintain efficiency dynamically
   - Optimized memory usage in LinkedList and HashMap implementations

7. Data Manipulation:
   - Implemented the ability to traverse and manipulate bid data using iterators

8. Error Handling:
   - Implemented error handling and edge case management in data structure operations

## Reflection on the Enhancement Process

The development process for my full-stack application has been very challenging, and I have more to do. There were a lot of methods and tools that I had to research and learn how to implement from scratch. With these new methods and tools, I also had to learn how to troubleshoot bugs and errors that were also new to me. Most of my time has been spent troubleshooting the code. I hate to say it, but I am surprised I have progressed as far as I am. At the same time, I am relieved that I can achieve everything I have so far. At the beginning of the course, I felt a bit overwhelmed, but as I started to show progress in my application, I grew more confident. As I add new tools and methods, I keep discovering potential implementations to improve my work.
